          <p class="mb-4">
            1st lesson on covid 19 was that life is really short, that any day could come as our last so we must live life to the fullest. The word “carpe diem” or sieze the day is really an inspiration that, whatever we can do today, we should do it now; do not wait unto tomorrow to do it. Life is really short to be living depressed or down on things, that we tend to miss out on what is important. So while you are young and can do it, go for it; do not doze around doing nothing or just sleeping, because there is a lot of time for that when you grow old.

          <h2 class="tm-page-title">2nd Lesson </h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            2nd lesson is that we should appreciate things around us, because not many people are lucky to have a free life. Be appreciative of what you have and thank GOD for the blessings each day that he has bestowed upon you. We focus on things that we don’t have and give less focus on things we have. That’s why people get jealous of other people just because they have this or that, that doesn’t matter because when we die, we leave our worldly possesions here; you cannot take them to where you are going so be more appreciative and thankful each day.</p>

          <h2 class="tm-page-title">3rd Lesson </h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            3rd lesson is spirituality, your connection with GOD. Many of us has forgoten about him, because of our day to day lives, but he hasn’t forgoten about us. We go out of bound because our desires that we lose focus on things that are more important. When this pandemic started you had a lot of time to think and to realize everything he has done for you, you really tend to think more because of isolation; that your mind goes to places and also of course thinking about your future. That is not bad and all, but we have tu believe and trust in his plans, will and perfect timing for us. This time has really got me thinking that my life is sacred because GOD blesses me everyday, guides and protects me. Food is for the body and the bible is for the soul, we need to balance things out and make it work. It was a really scary part also for me being left alone, isolated in your own mind; thankfuly i get to talk to GOD everday and that just shows me how much i need him more in my life.

          <h2 class="tm-page-title">4th Lesson </h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            4th lesson is that life is really hard or unfair, that everything we go through are challenges, that builds us to become a better person. That without these challenges or obstacles in life, what would we be; we would be clueless and weak. We become better by experiences, regrets and failures. That’s what it means to be human, we are imperfect, but we have the chance to try each day to succeed. We only lose if we quit, each day is a trial/obstacle because we don’t know what tomorrow holds; it’s okay to feel depressed and useless at times. But don’t stay there for too long, because we have another day to restart and feel refreshed to try again.</p>

          <h2 class="tm-page-title">5th Lesson </h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            5th lesson is self-love, we tend sometimes to hate or neglect ourselves, because of things that might have happened in our lives. This time has also showed me that, what you think of yourself is important; thank what others think of you. Your own happiness and peace is of importance, because this is where it all starts; if you know you can love yourself, then you can love another. As the saying goes in the bible “love your neighbours as you love yourself”. Sometimes we go searching for people thinking they would complete us, but no. The only thing that can complete us is GOD, family and yourself. We tend to feel lonely, sad and depressed. But that is not a go signal for you to be entering a relationship, learn to love yourself first, before loving another. Everything at the right time will fall into place, rest easy, and be at peace. We are being taken care of by an everlasting, loving and caring GOD.</p>
